- 👋 Hi, I’m @arineko, which is a really interesting codename, right? It's a little 'word game' between the word ARIGATOU and OBRIGADO,
respectively Japanese and Portuguese. If you take the part "gato", and translate it into japanese, you have "neko".
Finally, you get a mix of ARI- which is part of thank you, and neko, which is the translation of the word "cat", in Portuguese! Crazy, right?

- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about how to create meaningful projects, even though I'm a begginner. I would also like to find means of
making the Japanese language more ''acessible'' through apps. I'm also interested in being part of something big, and learning in a professional
environment with a 'worldwide' purpose - HIRE ME!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java but people have been telling me I should study JavaScript. I guess I'm waiting for a professional opportunity to lead me
to my second programming language.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on meaningful projects and with people who are willing to collaborate with mine!

- 📫 How to reach me -> my e-mail is arinekodobrasil@gmail.com
